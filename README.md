# Healthcare-dashboard-using-powerbi

## Description 
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics for a healthcare provider in the UK. I used a dataset that included information on patient demographics, medical procedures, and billing. To start, I cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Then, I used Power BI to create interactive visualizations, like this map showing regional billing variations and these charts breaking down costs by procedure and department. The key takeaways are: one, the average billing per visit is £674; two, cardiology has the highest departmental billing at 25%; three, the average out-of-pocket expense is £227; four, hypertension accounts for 22% of diagnoses; and five, the total insurance coverage is £2 million. This dashboard helps providers identify trends, manage costs, and improve patient care.

## Overview

This interactive healthcare dashboard provides hospital administrators, medical staff, and data analysts with actionable insights into patient admissions, treatment outcomes, and operational efficiency. Built using Power BI/Tableau/Streamlit, it transforms raw patient data into visual, filterable KPIs to optimize resource allocation, reduce costs, and improve care quality.

## Key Features
**1. Patient Admission & Discharge Tracking**
- Visualize daily/monthly admission trends to anticipate seasonal spikes (e.g., flu season).
- Monitor discharge statuses (Recovered, Referred, Deceased) to evaluate treatment effectiveness.
- Compare department-wise patient volumes (Cardiology, Neurology, etc.) for staffing adjustments.

**2. Treatment Cost & Efficiency Analysis**
- Identify high-cost departments and procedures using average treatment cost metrics.
- Detect length-of-stay outliers to reduce inefficiencies (e.g., patients staying 20+ days).
- Cost vs. Outcome Correlation: Analyze if higher spending improves recovery rates.

**3. Outcome Performance Metrics**
- Recovery Rate: (Recovered Patients / Total Discharged) × 100
- Mortality Rate: (Deceased Patients / Total Discharged) × 100
- Readmission Risk: Flag patients with recurring visits for targeted care.

**4. Interactive Data Exploration**
- Dynamic Filters: Slice data by:
- Time (monthly/quarterly trends)
- Department (compare Neurology vs. Cardiology)
- Demographics (age groups, gender)
- Region (multi-branch hospital comparisons)
- Drill-Down Capability: Click on charts to explore underlying patient records.

**5. Actionable Reporting**
- Automated Alerts: Highlight departments with abnormally high mortality rates.
- Exportable Reports: Generate PDF/Excel summaries for stakeholder meetings.
